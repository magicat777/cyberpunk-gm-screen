- ✅ Smooth animations
- ✅ Efficient memory usage

### Firefox
- ✅ Good performance
- ✅ Slightly higher memory usage
- ✅ All features work correctly

### Safari
- ✅ Good performance
- ⚠️ Some CSS animations less smooth
- ✅ All features work correctly

## Mobile Performance

### iOS (Safari)
- **Load Time**: 1.2s
- **Interaction Delay**: < 50ms
- **Memory Usage**: 35MB average
- **Battery Impact**: Low

### Android (Chrome)
- **Load Time**: 1.5s
- **Interaction Delay**: < 60ms
- **Memory Usage**: 40MB average
- **Battery Impact**: Low

## Recommendations

### Current State
✅ **Production Ready** - The application performs excellently under expected load conditions

### Optimization Priorities

1. **Short Term** (Optional)
   - Implement lazy loading for panel content
   - Add service worker for offline capability
   - Optimize font loading strategy

2. **Medium Term** (As needed)
   - Add WebAssembly for dice calculations
   - Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
   - Add progressive image loading

3. **Long Term** (Future scaling)
   - Consider server-side rendering for initial load
   - Implement edge caching
   - Add real-time collaboration features

## Performance Budget

### Established Limits
