- Test Notes panel functionality:
  - Create a notes panel
  - Add content and save

## Screenshots
N/A - Functional fixes are not visually apparent but resolve critical operation issues.

## Additional Notes
This PR resolves several critical issues from our tracking system (CP-001, CP-002, CP-008, CP-010, CP-012). The most important fixes are to the JavaScript errors that were preventing proper functionality and the notes panel storage system. The skip link enhancement improves accessibility for keyboard users.

Remaining issues have been documented in the issue tracker and prioritized for future work.
