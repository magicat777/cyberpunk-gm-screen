# Layout Save & Load Functionality Fixes

## Summary
- Fixed critical Save & Load functionality in the Layout menu
- Resolved JavaScript display issues with panel organization functions
- Fixed browser compatibility issues for Safari
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Added accessibility enhancements

## Details

### Critical Fixes
1. **Fixed Missing Script Tag**: Resolved a critical issue where a missing script tag was causing JavaScript to be rendered as text on the page.

2. **Implemented Layout Functions**: Added robust implementations of panel organization functions:
   - clearLayout (removes all panels)
   - autoOrganizePanels (arranges panels in a grid)
   - fitPanelsToWindow (organizes panels by type)

3. **Fixed Duplicate IDs**: Resolved accessibility issues caused by duplicate element IDs:
   - export-layout → app-export-layout
   - import-layout → app-import-layout
   - toggle-autosave → app-toggle-autosave

4. **Added Browser Compatibility**: Fixed CSS issues for Safari compatibility:
   - Added -webkit-backdrop-filter for blur effects
   - Added -webkit-user-select for user selection control
   - Corrected vendor prefix ordering

5. **Improved Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms for all layout functions.

### Implementation Approach
The implementation uses a cascading fallback system to ensure maximum compatibility:
1. First tries local function implementations
2. Then tries window.* functions
3. Then tries CyberpunkGM.Layout.* functions
4. Finally falls back to inline implementations

This ensures that the functionality works even if specific implementations are missing or not loaded correctly.

### Testing
The fixes have been tested in multiple scenarios:
- Panel manipulation (adding, removing, organizing)
- Layout export/import
- Browser compatibility

## Test Plan
1. Access the application and add several panels
2. Test the Clear Layout button
3. Test the Auto-Organize button
4. Test the Fit to Window button
5. Export the layout and verify the file download
6. Import a previously exported layout
7. Verify that Auto-Save functionality works
8. Test in multiple browsers, including Safari

## Additional Notes
These changes focus on fixing critical functionality issues while maintaining the existing architecture. Future work should consider a more comprehensive refactoring to improve modularity and maintainability.
