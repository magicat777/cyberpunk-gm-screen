# Debug Panel Consolidation Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
- **CP-009**: Duplicate debug tool panels - Fixed the issue of both "Debug Tools" and "Emergency Debug Tools" panels being displayed with different behaviors.

## Solution Overview
1. Created a new `debug-init.js` script to consolidate debug panel functionality
2. Ensured all debug panel creation functions point to the same implementation
3. Added panel cleanup to detect and remove duplicate debug panels
4. Properly updated button states and ARIA attributes for accessibility

## Changes Made
1. **Created a new initialization script**:
   - `debug-init.js` that redirects all emergency debug functions and removes duplicates

2. **Removed inline emergency debug panel creation**:
   - Removed redundant inline script in `app-modern-accessible-fixed.html`
   - Simplified the debug button implementation

3. **Applied proper event handling**:
   - Used event delegation to ensure the debug button works properly
   - Set 'aria-expanded' attribute to manage accessibility state

4. **Implemented cleanup routines**:
   - Added immediate cleanup of duplicate panels
   - Added delayed cleanup to catch asynchronously created panels

5. **Added thorough testing**:
   - Created a `debug-panel-test.html` test page
   - Added test cases for all debug panel creation methods
