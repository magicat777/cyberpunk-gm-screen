This guide will help you use the GM Tools added to the Cyberpunk RED GM Screen. These tools are designed to make your job as a Game Master easier by providing quick access to notes, dice rolling, and rules references.

2. **Dice Roller** - A specialized dice roller for Cyberpunk RED with exploding dice support
3. **Rules Reference** - Quick access to important game rules

Click on any of these items to add them to your desktop. You can have multiple instances of each tool open at once.

   - Use the minimize button (_) to collapse a panel temporarily
   - Use the close button (Ã—) to remove a panel

2. **Multiple Panels**:

   - For example, keep separate note panels for NPCs, plot points, and combat

3. **Keyboard Focus**:
