# Pull Request: Resolve HTML Page Conflicts

## Summary
- Synchronized HTML pages between src/frontend/pages and docs/pages directories
- Created utility scripts to verify and maintain page synchronization
- Ensured consistent structure with standardized navigation and footers
- Preserved detailed content for all information pages

## Implementation Details

### 1. Page Synchronization
All HTML pages in the pages directory have been synchronized to ensure they have both:
- Rich, detailed content with comprehensive information
- Standardized structure with consistent navigation and footer

The following files have been synchronized:
- about.html
- attributions.html
- feedback.html
- help.html
- license.html
- privacy.html
- shortcuts.html

### 2. Consistent Structure
Each page now maintains a consistent structure:
- Standardized header with toolbar navigation
- Main content section with page-specific information
- Standardized footer with links to all documentation pages
- Consistent styling and formatting

### 3. Tools for Maintenance
Created utilities to help maintain synchronization:
- check_pages.py: Python script to verify and synchronize pages
- Documentation on proper workflow for updating pages

## Test Plan
- Verified all HTML pages render correctly with proper format
- Confirmed all links between pages work correctly
- Tested responsive layout on different screen sizes
- Validated consistent header and footer across all pages
