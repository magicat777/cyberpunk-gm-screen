# Fixing the GitHub Workflow Issue

GitHub has rejected our push because the branch contains a workflow file (`.github/workflows/navigation-validation.yml`) and your Personal Access Token doesn't have the `workflow` scope. This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized workflow changes.

## Two Options to Resolve This:

### Option 1: Add the `workflow` Scope to Your Token (Recommended)

1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens
2. Find your current token or create a new one
3. Make sure to check the `workflow` scope
4. Save the token and try pushing again

### Option 2: Remove the Workflow File from Your Branch

If you don't want to update your token, you can remove the workflow file:

```bash
# Remove the workflow file
git rm .github/workflows/navigation-validation.yml

# Commit the removal
git commit -m "Remove workflow file to allow push with limited token scope"

# Push again
git push -u origin feature/navigation-implementation
```

### Option 3: Create a PR Without the Workflow File

1. Create a new branch from your current feature branch but without the workflow file:

```bash
# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature/navigation-implementation-no-workflow

# Remove the workflow file
git rm .github/workflows/navigation-validation.yml

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Remove workflow file to allow push with limited token scope"

# Push this branch instead
git push -u origin feature/navigation-implementation-no-workflow
```

2. Then create a PR from this branch instead.

## Recommendation

Option 1 is the most straightforward if you plan to work with workflows in this repository in the future. Option 2 removes the file but keeps your branch name. Option 3 creates a clean branch without the workflow file.

Choose the option that best fits your workflow needs.
