# Character and World Panel Fix PR

## Summary

This PR fixes the non-functioning Character and World panel menus in the Cyberpunk GM Screen application. Users were unable to access panel types such as Character Sheet, NPC Generator, Loot Generator, Night City Map, Location Generator, and Random Encounter.

## Changes

- **New Script: panel-fix.js**: Implemented a robust fix that resolves scope issues with panel creation functions and ensures event handlers are properly attached
- **Enhanced debug-panel.js**: Improved debugging capabilities to help diagnose and resolve the panel issues
- **Added Test Page**: Created panel-test.html for testing and validating the panel functionality
- **Documentation**: Added detailed documentation of the issue and fix implementation

## Technical Details

The fix addresses several root causes of the panel functionality issues:

1. **Function Scope Problems**: Ensures panel creation functions are properly exposed to the global scope
2. **Event Handler Conflicts**: Replaces existing event handlers with new ones that include proper error handling
3. **Error Handling**: Improves error reporting and provides fallback behavior when panel creation fails

## Testing

- Verified all panel creation functions are correctly exposed to the global scope
- Tested each menu item to ensure event handlers are properly attached
- Confirmed that each panel type can be created successfully
- Tested error cases to verify proper error reporting and fallback behavior

## Screenshots
