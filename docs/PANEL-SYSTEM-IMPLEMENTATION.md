# Cyberpunk GM Screen - Panel System Implementation

## Overview

The Panel System is a core component of the Cyberpunk GM Screen application, providing a flexible interface for creating, managing, and interacting with different content panels. This document describes the implementation details, architecture, and usage of the enhanced panel system.

## Key Features

- **Standalone Implementation**: Functions without dependencies on external libraries
- **Accessibility**: Fully keyboard navigable with ARIA attributes and screen reader support
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with user-friendly notifications
- **Performance Optimization**: Uses requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- **Responsive Design**: Panels remain within viewport bounds even during window resize
- **Multiple Panel Types**: Supports various panel types (notes, dice roller, rules reference, etc.)

## Architecture

The panel system follows a modular architecture with these key components:

1. **Core Functions**:
   - `createAccessiblePanel()`: Primary function for creating new panels
   - `showNotification()`: Displays user notifications
   - `initAccessibility()`: Sets up accessibility features

2. **Panel Management**:
   - Each panel has a unique ID and maintains its own state
   - All panels are tracked in a central state object
   - Position, size, and content are managed through the panel API

3. **Event Delegation**:
   - Uses event delegation for efficient event handling
   - Panel buttons and controls share common event handlers

4. **Accessibility Layer**:
   - Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
   - ARIA attributes for screen reader compatibility
   - Focus management for improved usability

## Usage

### Creating Panels

The main entry point for creating panels is the `createAccessiblePanel()` function:

```javascript
// Create a notes panel
const panelId = createAccessiblePanel('notes', {
    x: 100,        // Left position
    y: 100,        // Top position
    width: 400,    // Panel width
    height: 300    // Panel height
});
```

### Panel Types

The system supports multiple panel types:

- **notes**: Simple text editor
- **dice**: Dice roller with history
- **rules**: Rules reference tables
- **character**: Character sheet editor
- **npc**: NPC generator
- **weapons**: Weapons reference table
- **armor**: Armor reference table
- **critical**: Critical injuries table
- **netrunning**: Netrunning reference
- **initiative**: Initiative tracker
- **timer**: Game timer
- **calculator**: Calculator with dice shortcuts
- **map**: Night City map
- **location**: Location generator
- **encounter**: Random encounter generator
- **loot**: Loot generator

### Notifications

The system provides a notification system for user feedback:

```javascript
showNotification('Panel created successfully', 'success', 3000);
```

Notification types:
- **info**: General information
- **success**: Operation completed successfully
- **error**: Error occurred
- **warning**: Warning message

## DOM Structure

Each panel follows this DOM structure:

```html
<section class="panel" tabindex="0" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="panel-title-[id]">
  <header class="panel-header" role="button" aria-grabbed="false">
    <div class="panel-title" id="panel-title-[id]">Panel Title</div>
    <div class="panel-controls">
      <button class="close-button" aria-label="Close panel">&times;</button>
    </div>
  </header>
  <div class="panel-content">
    <!-- Panel-specific content goes here -->
  </div>
  <div class="resize-handle" tabindex="0" role="button" 
       aria-label="Resize panel (use arrow keys when focused)"></div>
</section>
```

## Keyboard Support

The panel system provides comprehensive keyboard navigation:

- **Tab**: Move focus between panels and interactive elements
- **Enter/Space**: Activate buttons, toggle modes
- **Arrow Keys**:
  - With panel focused + Shift: Move panel
  - With resize handle focused: Resize panel
- **Escape**: Close panel or exit active mode

## Error Handling

The system includes robust error handling:

1. **Input Validation**: Parameters are validated before use
2. **Try-Catch Blocks**: All critical operations are wrapped in try-catch
3. **User Notifications**: Errors trigger user-friendly notifications
4. **Fallbacks**: Alternative implementations when primary approaches fail
5. **Console Logging**: Detailed error information in browser console

## Browser Compatibility

The panel system is designed to work across modern browsers with fallbacks:

- Uses Pointer Events API with mouse event fallback
- Checks for required browser features
- Provides graceful degradation when features are missing

## Event Lifecycle

When a panel is created, this sequence occurs:

1. Parameter validation and processing
2. DOM element creation with proper attributes
3. Event listener attachment
4. Panel initialization based on type
5. Addition to central state tracking

When a panel is closed:

1. Event listeners are removed to prevent memory leaks
2. Panel is removed from central state tracking
3. Panel element is removed from the DOM
4. User is notified of the action

## Performance Considerations

The implementation includes several performance optimizations:

- **requestAnimationFrame**: Used for smooth animations
- **Event Delegation**: Minimizes event listener count
- **Cleanup**: All event listeners and references are properly removed
- **Throttling**: Animations and intensive operations are throttled
- **Efficient DOM Updates**: Batch DOM operations where possible

## Testing

A dedicated test suite is available to verify the panel system functionality:

- **Test File**: `panel-system-test.html`
- **Test Script**: `js/panel-tests.js`

Run the tests by opening the test file and clicking "Run Panel Tests".

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements:

1. **Panel Snapping**: Add grid-based snapping for easier alignment
2. **Panel Templates**: Allow custom panel templates
3. **Panel Groups**: Group related panels together
4. **Panel Minimization**: Allow panels to be minimized/maximized
5. **Persistence**: Save panel layouts between sessions
