# Cyberpunk RED GM Interface v2.0.77

This is a forked version of the Cyberpunk RED GM Screen, focused on fixing issues with the desktop interface and enhancing overall performance and stability.

## About This Fork

The original project was deployed to GitHub Pages but had several issues with the desktop.html interface:

1. Panel movement and resizing issues that caused the interface to lock up
2. UI diagnostics panel with non-functional action buttons
3. State saving and profile management problems

This fork aims to fix these issues while maintaining compatibility with the original features.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Panel Interaction
- Fixed drag and resize functionality to prevent UI lockups
- Improved performance with debouncing and animation frame optimization
- Added proper event cleanup to prevent memory leaks

### 2. Robust State Management
- Improved error handling for storage operations
- Added data validation to prevent corrupted settings
- Implemented fallback mechanisms when settings can't be loaded

### 3. Better UI Diagnostics
- Fixed action buttons in the diagnostics panel
- Added emergency reset functionality (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Enhanced diagnostics for panel event handlers

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- Reduced unnecessary DOM operations
- Implemented GPU acceleration for panel movements
- Optimized CSS selectors and style recalculations

## Getting Started

1. Access the interface at [GitHub Pages URL]
2. Use the improved desktop interface with the new features
3. If any issues occur, use the UI Diagnostics panel (accessible from the sidebar)

## Known Limitations

- This fork focuses on fixing desktop.html interface issues and does not add new game features
- While compatible with the original data format, we recommend backing up your data before using this fork
