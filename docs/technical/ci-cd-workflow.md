# Cyberpunk RED GM Screen - CI/CD Workflow

This document outlines the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices for the Cyberpunk RED GM Screen project. While this is primarily a local development project, implementing CI/CD principles ensures code quality, consistent versioning, and reliable deployment.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Branching Strategy

Though this is a local project, we follow a simplified Git Flow branching strategy:

- **main**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for feature work
- **feature/xxx**: Feature-specific branches
- **bugfix/xxx**: Bug fix branches
- **release/x.x.x**: Release preparation branches

#### Branch Naming Convention

```
feature/CP-YYYY-MM-XXX-brief-description
bugfix/CP-YYYY-MM-XXX-brief-description
```

Where:
- **CP**: Project prefix
- **YYYY-MM**: Year and month
- **XXX**: Sequential number for the checkpoint
- **brief-description**: Short description using kebab-case

### 2. Checkpoint System

All significant changes are tracked with a checkpoint identifier:

```
CP-YYYY-MM-XXX
```

Where:
- **CP**: Project prefix
- **YYYY-MM**: Year and month
- **XXX**: Sequential number (e.g., 001, 002)

Example: `CP-2023-05-001` represents the first checkpoint in May 2023.

Checkpoints should be referenced in:
- Commit messages
- Documentation updates
- Version log entries

### 3. Development Process

1. **Issue Tracking**
   - Create a new issue or task
   - Assign a checkpoint ID
   - Reference user story ID where applicable

2. **Local Development**
   - Create a feature branch from develop
   - Implement the feature or fix
   - Test locally

3. **Code Review**
   - Self-review code for quality and standards
   - Document changes thoroughly
   - Update version log

4. **Integration**
   - Merge feature branch to develop
   - Test integration
   - Resolve any conflicts

5. **Release**
   - Merge develop to main for production
   - Tag with version number
   - Update documentation

## Versioning

### Version Numbering

The project follows Semantic Versioning with a checkpoint reference:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-CP-YYYY-MM-XXX
```

Where:
- **MAJOR**: Incremented for incompatible API changes
- **MINOR**: Incremented for backwards-compatible functionality
- **PATCH**: Incremented for backwards-compatible bug fixes
- **CP-YYYY-MM-XXX**: Checkpoint reference

Example: `1.2.3-CP-2023-05-001`

### Version Log

The version log is maintained in the main README.md file and includes:

- Checkpoint ID
- Date of change
- Brief description of changes
- References to user stories or requirements
- Contributors

## Testing Framework

Though formal CI tooling isn't used, we follow these testing practices:

### 1. Manual Testing Checklist

Before any merge to develop or main:

- [ ] Application loads correctly
- [ ] All panels can be added from sidebar
- [ ] Draggable functionality works
- [ ] Layout persistence works
- [ ] Profiles can be saved and loaded
- [ ] UI customizations function correctly
- [ ] Server starts and stops properly
- [ ] Documentation is up to date

### 2. Browser Compatibility

Test on the following browsers:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Edge (latest)

### 3. Cross-platform Testing

- Windows 11 native
- WSL environment
- Linux (if available)

## Deployment Process

### 1. Pre-deployment Checklist

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Version number updated
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Version log entry added
- [ ] All server scripts tested

### 2. Deployment Steps

1. **Prepare Release**
   - Update version numbers in code and documentation
   - Create release note in version log
   - Create tag with version number

2. **Deploy to Production**
   - Copy files to production location
   - Test server startup
   - Verify functionality

3. **Post-deployment Verification**
   - Access application through browser
   - Verify all features work
   - Check server logs for errors

### 3. Rollback Procedure

If deployment fails:
1. Restore previous version from backup
2. Document issues in version log
3. Create bugfix branch to address issues

## Quality Gates

Though we don't use automated CI/CD tools, we enforce these quality gates:

### 1. Code Quality Standards

- JavaScript follows ES6+ standards
- CSS uses BEM-like naming convention with 'cp-' prefix
- HTML is valid and accessible
- Documentation is clear and complete

### 2. Performance Criteria

- Initial load time under 3 seconds
- Panel drag operations are smooth (60fps)
- localStorage operations don't block UI
- Memory usage remains stable with 20+ panels

### 3. Documentation Requirements

- All user-facing features have user documentation
- Technical implementations are documented
- API and function documentation for JavaScript
- Deployment process is documented
- Version log is maintained

## Monitoring and Feedback

### 1. Error Monitoring

- Browser console errors are logged
- Server errors are captured in logs
- Critical errors are documented and addressed promptly

### 2. User Feedback

- Document user suggestions
- Prioritize feedback for future development
- Track common issues or questions

## Tools and Resources

### Development Tools

1. **Code Editor**
   - Visual Studio Code (recommended)
   - With ESLint and HTML/CSS validators

2. **Browser Tools**
   - Chrome/Firefox DevTools
   - Performance profiling
   - localStorage inspection

3. **Version Control**
   - Git for local versioning
   - GitHub for remote backup (optional)

### Documentation and Standards

1. **Documentation**
   - Markdown for all documentation
   - JSDoc for JavaScript documentation
   - BEM methodology for CSS
   - Semantic HTML5

2. **Code Standards**
   - ESLint configuration
   - Prettier for formatting
   - EditorConfig for consistency
