# Notes Panel Troubleshooting Checkpoint

## Current Issues (May 9, 2025)

1. **Maximum call stack size exceeded error**
   - Occurs in `panel-implementations-fixed.js` when creating a notes panel
   - Circular reference issue between function calls
   - Attempted countermeasures: added attempt counters, function separation, standalone implementations

2. **querySelector is not a function error**
   - Occurs in emergency fallback implementation in HTML
   - Attempted countermeasures: rewritten with older JS syntax, removed querySelector in favor of getElementById

3. **Syntax errors**
   - Some browsers report unexpected token errors with try-catch blocks
   - Modern JavaScript features may not be fully supported

## Next Steps

1. **Emergency Workaround**
   - Consider adding a completely independent backup notes system, possibly as a separate module
   - Create a direct version using only the most basic DOM manipulation methods

2. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Revisit the panel hierarchy implementation 
   - Consider changing the architecture to avoid circular references entirely
   - Review the script loading order and dependencies

3. **Compatibility Improvements**
   - Test with multiple browsers to identify compatibility issues
   - Consider adding a runtime detection for browser capabilities
   - Create feature detection for modern JS features

## Technical Notes

- Core issue appears to be in how panels reference each other and shared functions
- The problem is exacerbated by potential browser incompatibilities
- A complete refactoring of the panel system architecture may be necessary

## Work Completed

- Added attempt counting and termination conditions to prevent infinite recursion
- Created standalone fallback implementations that don't rely on shared panel functions
- Added more robust error reporting and debug tools
- Added defensive coding patterns throughout

To be continued on next work session.
