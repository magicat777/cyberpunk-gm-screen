## Test Procedure

1. Copy the test plan to a new document for recording results
2. For each test, mark status as:
   - ✅ PASS - Test passed successfully
   - ❌ FAIL - Test failed (include details about the failure)
   - ⚠️ PARTIAL - Test partially passed (include details)
   - ⏩ SKIP - Test was skipped (include reason)

3. For any failures, document:
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs. actual behavior
   - Screenshots if applicable
   - Browser/device information

## Regression Testing

After fixing any issues found during testing, repeat the relevant tests to ensure:

1. The fix resolves the identified issue
2. The fix doesn't introduce new issues
3. The fix works across all test environments

## Test Completion Criteria

The panel system is considered successfully tested when:

1. All tests marked as PASS
2. Any PARTIAL or FAIL tests have documented workarounds or fixes in progress
3. Testing has been completed in all required environments
4. No critical or high-priority issues remain unresolved

## Issue Prioritization

- **Critical**: Issues that completely prevent panel creation or basic functionality
- **High**: Issues that significantly impact usability but have workarounds
- **Medium**: Functional issues that have easy workarounds
- **Low**: Minor visual or non-functional issues
