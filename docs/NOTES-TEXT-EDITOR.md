   - Markdown support
   - Fullscreen editing mode
   - Word and character count
   - Document status updates
   - Customizable styling

## Implementation Details

The enhanced notes text editor is implemented in `notes-text-editor.js` which provides a complete replacement for the previous notes panel implementation. It is designed to work with the existing panel system while providing a significantly enhanced user experience.

### Architecture

The implementation follows a modular approach:

1. **Core Panel Creation**
   - `createEnhancedNotesPanel()`: Main function that creates and initializes the panel
   - Integrates with the existing panel system via `createPanel()`

2. **UI Components**
   - Document selector bar for managing multiple notes
   - Advanced formatting toolbar with grouped buttons
   - Main editor area (contenteditable div with styling)
   - Status and word count footer

3. **Storage System**
   - Uses localStorage with a structured JSON format
   - Supports multiple documents with metadata
   - Automatic saving with debounce

4. **Helper Functions**
   - Format conversion (HTML ↔ Markdown)
   - Dialog system for user interactions
   - Import/export functionality

### Integration

The editor integrates with the existing codebase in the following ways:

1. Script inclusion in main application:
   ```html
   <script src="js/notes-text-editor.js"></script>
   ```

2. Preference in panel creation:
   ```javascript
   window.createNotesPanel = function() {
       // First try to use the enhanced notes editor if available
       if (typeof window.createEnhancedNotesPanel === 'function') {
           try {
               return window.createEnhancedNotesPanel();
           } catch (e) {
               // Fall through to standard implementation if enhanced version fails
           }
       }
       
       // Fallback to previous implementations
       // ...
   };
   ```

3. Styling that complements the existing Cyberpunk theme

## User Guide

### Basic Usage

1. Open a Notes panel from the panel menu
2. Use the formatting toolbar to style your text
3. Notes are automatically saved as you type

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl+B**: Bold
- **Ctrl+I**: Italic
- **Ctrl+U**: Underline
- **Ctrl+K**: Insert link
- **Ctrl+S**: Save manually
- **F11**: Toggle fullscreen mode
- **Esc**: Exit fullscreen mode

### Document Management

- Click "New" to create a new note document
- Use the dropdown to switch between notes
- Click "Rename" to change the name of the current note
- Click "Delete" to remove the current note (cannot delete the default note)

### Export/Import

- Click the export button (↓) to export in HTML, plain text, or Markdown format
- Click the import button (↑) to import from a file

## Technical Notes

### Browser Compatibility

The implementation uses standard modern web APIs and should work in all major browsers:
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
- Uses contentEditable and document.execCommand APIs
- LocalStorage for data persistence

### Fallback Mechanism

In case of errors, the implementation includes a robust fallback mechanism:
1. First tries to use the enhanced editor
2. Falls back to the standard notes panel implementation if that fails
3. Uses standalone implementation as a last resort
4. Provides basic text area if all else fails

### Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future improvement:
- Image uploading capabilities
- Cloud sync functionality
- Collaborative editing
- Enhanced table editing tools
- More export formats

## Testing

The implementation includes a dedicated test page (`notes-editor-test.html`) that demonstrates the functionality in a controlled environment. Use this page to:
- Test feature compatibility
- Verify styling
- Check integration with the panel system
- Experiment with different note types and formats
