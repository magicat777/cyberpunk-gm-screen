   - **site-connectivity.drawio**: Visual diagram of site structure and component relationships

2. **Code Reference Documentation**
   - **CLAUDE-CODE-INDEX.md**: Comprehensive function and component index with line numbers
   - **CLAUDE-FUNCTION-MAP.js**: JavaScript object for fast function lookup
   - **CLAUDE-CSS-MAP.md**: CSS selector reference with file locations and purposes
   - **CLAUDE-CONNECTIVITY-MAP.md**: Detailed component relationship mapping

3. **GitHub-Specific Documentation**
   - **GITHUB-CODE-NAVIGATOR.md**: GitHub Pages specific reference system
   - Path translation between local and GitHub Pages

4. **Panel System Documentation**
   - **PANEL-SYSTEM-FIXES-SUMMARY.md**: Summary of fixes applied to the panel system
   - **PANEL-SYSTEM-IMPLEMENTATION.md**: Implementation details for the panel system

## Documentation Purpose

These documents were created to serve several key purposes:

1. **Code Navigation**: Enable fast lookup of specific code components
   - Direct line numbers for all important functions
   - File paths for quick access to relevant code
   - Component relationships to understand dependencies

2. **Documentation Standards**: Establish consistent documentation patterns
   - Structured formats for technical references
   - Clear organization of code components
   - Coherent naming schemes for documentation files

3. **Maintenance Support**: Facilitate easier maintenance of the codebase
   - Quick reference for bug fixes
   - Clear component relationships for impact analysis
   - Comprehensive CSS selector reference for styling changes

4. **GitHub Integration**: Better support for GitHub Pages hosting
   - Path translation between local and GitHub environments
   - GitHub-specific URL patterns for direct references
   - Branch-specific considerations for deployment

## Key Features

1. **CLAUDE-FUNCTION-MAP.js**
   - JavaScript object with precise line number references
   - Contains function signatures, locations, and descriptions
   - Includes relationships between functions (callers and callees)
   - Supports fuzzy matching for partial function name lookups

2. **CLAUDE-CODE-INDEX.md**
   - Structured by function type and component
   - Direct line number references for all important code
   - Includes code pattern examples for common operations
   - Quick fix guide for common issues

3. **CLAUDE-CSS-MAP.md**
   - Organized by component and theme
   - Maps CSS variables to their values and purposes
   - Documents animation effects and their implementations
   - Highlights accessibility-related selectors

4. **site-connectivity.drawio**
   - Visual representation of site structure
   - Shows relationships between components
   - Maps theme system architecture
   - Documents JavaScript dependency chains

5. **GITHUB-CODE-NAVIGATOR.md**
   - GitHub-specific URL patterns for quick navigation
   - Direct links to key files in the repository
   - Branch-specific reference considerations
   - Documentation of GitHub Pages deployment structure

## Usage Examples

1. **Finding a Function**
   ```javascript
   // Using CLAUDE-FUNCTION-MAP.js
   const functionInfo = FUNCTION_MAP.findFunction("initAccessibility");
   console.log(`Function located at ${functionInfo.path}:${functionInfo.line}`);
   ```

2. **Locating a CSS Selector**
   - Check CLAUDE-CSS-MAP.md for the component category
   - Find the selector in the appropriate table
   - Use the file path and line number to locate the code

3. **Understanding Component Relationships**
   - Reference CLAUDE-CONNECTIVITY-MAP.md for component dependencies
   - Check the relationship diagrams in site-connectivity.drawio
   - Follow the dependency chains to understand impact of changes

4. **Finding GitHub-Specific URLs**
   - Use GITHUB-CODE-NAVIGATOR.md to translate local paths to GitHub URLs
   - Reference the direct links table for common files
   - Use line number patterns for specific code references

## Maintenance Guidelines

1. **Updating Reference Documentation**
   - Update line numbers when significant code changes occur
   - Add new functions to CLAUDE-FUNCTION-MAP.js as they are created
   - Add new CSS selectors to CLAUDE-CSS-MAP.md when styling changes

2. **Expanding Documentation**
   - Add component-specific documentation as needed
   - Create additional reference maps for new subsystems
   - Enhance visual diagrams as the architecture evolves

3. **Keeping GitHub References Current**
   - Update GITHUB-CODE-NAVIGATOR.md when repository structure changes
   - Ensure branch references remain accurate
   - Update links when file paths change

## Conclusion

The comprehensive documentation created provides a solid foundation for ongoing development and maintenance of the Cyberpunk GM Screen project. By establishing clear reference systems with precise line numbers and component relationships, the project is now easier to navigate, maintain, and extend.

The GitHub-specific documentation further enhances the usefulness for web-based deployment and development, ensuring that references work correctly regardless of whether the code is being viewed locally or through GitHub Pages.
