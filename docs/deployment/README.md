# Deployment Options for Cyberpunk GM Screen

This directory contains all deployment-related documentation for the Cyberpunk GM Screen.

## Recommended Option

[GitHub Pages Deployment](GITHUB-PAGES-GUIDE.md) - Free, simple static hosting with password protection.

## Key Benefits of GitHub Pages

- **100% Free**: No credit card required, no billing plans to manage
- **Simple Deployment**: Deploy directly from Git with automatic builds
- **Built-in Security**: HTTPS included by default
- **Password Protection**: Basic access control via client-side JavaScript
- **Global CDN**: Fast loading times worldwide
- **Custom Domain Support**: Use your own domain if desired
- **Reliable Infrastructure**: Backed by Microsoft/GitHub

## Alternative Options

The following deployment options were also evaluated:

- [Google Cloud Storage](GOOGLE-CLOUD-STORAGE-HOSTING.md)
- [Firebase Hosting](FIREBASE-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md)

These options were not selected because:
- Firebase's free tier restricts executable files
- Google Cloud Storage requires more complex setup and has no free tier with the same capabilities

## Deployment Process

The current deployment uses GitHub Pages with client-side password protection.
Your site will be accessible at: 
```
https://[your-github-username].github.io/cyberpunk-gm-screen/
```

Default password: `cyberpunk`

## Future Enhancement Options

With GitHub Pages as your foundation, you can later expand to:

1. **Add Backend Services**: 
   - Integrate with Firebase for authentication and database (when ready for monetization)
   - Add serverless functions through AWS Lambda, Vercel, or Netlify

2. **Implement Analytics**:
   - Add Google Analytics to track usage
   - Make data-driven improvements

3. **Monetization Paths**:
   - Integrate with payment processors
   - Implement subscription access through third-party services

## Technical Notes

All code is client-side HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application uses localStorage for client-side data persistence.
