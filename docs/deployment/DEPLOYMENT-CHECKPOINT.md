# Deployment Checkpoint: GitHub Pages Migration

## Migration Status: COMPLETED

**Date:** May 6, 2024  
**Deployed URL:** https://magicat777.github.io/cyberpunk-gm-screen/  
**Access Control:** Password protected ("cyberpunk")

## Migration Summary

The Cyberpunk GM Screen has been successfully migrated from a local-only application to a web-hosted version using GitHub Pages. This provides remote access to the GM Screen from any device with an internet connection.

### Completed Steps

1. ✅ Evaluated deployment options (Firebase, Google Cloud Storage, GitHub Pages)
2. ✅ Selected GitHub Pages as optimal solution
3. ✅ Created deployment scripts
4. ✅ Set up GitHub repository
5. ✅ Deployed application with password protection
6. ✅ Confirmed functionality on live site
7. ✅ Documented deployment process

## Deployment Files

The deployment includes:

- **index.html**: Password protection entry point
- **app.html**: Main application (renamed from fixed-super-minimal.html)
- **styles.css**: CSS styling
- **fonts/**: Custom fonts directory
- **images/**: Images and icons

## Benefits of GitHub Pages Migration

1. **Remote Access**: The GM Screen can now be accessed from any device
2. **No Local Server**: No need to run a local server or installation
3. **Simple Updates**: Changes can be deployed by pushing to GitHub
4. **Free Hosting**: No ongoing costs for hosting
5. **Basic Security**: Password protection for GM-only content

## Known Limitations

1. **Client-Side Authentication**: Password protection is JavaScript-based and not secure for sensitive data
2. **No Server Processing**: All functionality must be client-side
3. **localStorage Only**: Data persistence is limited to the browser's localStorage

## Next Steps

The successful GitHub Pages deployment establishes a foundation for the next phase of development:

- UI/UX modernization
- Additional GM tools and features
- Improved responsiveness for various devices

## Deployment Scripts

The following scripts were created to facilitate deployment:

1. **wsl-deploy.sh**: Prepares deployment files from the original codebase
2. **github-push-fix.sh**: Handles pushing to GitHub with authentication token

Documentation on the deployment process is available in `docs/deployment/GITHUB-PAGES-GUIDE.md`.
