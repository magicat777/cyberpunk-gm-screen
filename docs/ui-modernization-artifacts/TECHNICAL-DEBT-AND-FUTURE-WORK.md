# Technical Debt and Future Work

This document outlines the remaining technical debt and future enhancements for the Cyberpunk GM Screen application after the UI modernization effort.

## Remaining Technical Debt

### 1. Touch Support Implementation

The most significant piece of technical debt is the lack of touch event support for mobile devices. This includes:

- Touch event handlers for panel dragging
- Touch-based resizing (pinch-to-resize)
- Mobile-friendly UI controls
- Testing across various touch devices

**Priority:** High
**Effort:** Medium
**Impact:** High (affects mobile usability)

### 2. Test Coverage

The application currently lacks comprehensive testing. We should implement:

- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Accessibility testing with screen readers
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

**Priority:** Medium
**Effort:** High
**Impact:** Medium (affects reliability)

### 3. Build and Bundling System

The current implementation does not use a modern build system. We should consider:

- Adding a bundler (Webpack, Rollup, etc.)
- Implementing CSS preprocessing
- Adding code minification
- Implementing code splitting for performance

**Priority:** Low
**Effort:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium (affects performance and maintainability)

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Panel System

Enhance the panel system with:

- Panel grouping
- Panel snapping to edges and other panels
- Panel saving/loading per type
- Panel templates library

**Priority:** Medium
**Effort:** High
**Impact:** High (improves core functionality)

### 2. Offline Support

Implement offline capabilities:

- Service Worker for caching
- IndexedDB for data storage
- Offline-first architecture
- Synchronization when online

**Priority:** Low
**Effort:** High
**Impact:** Medium (improves reliability)

### 3. Enhanced Theme System

Improve the theme system with:

- User-created themes
- Theme editor
- Theme import/export
- Advanced visual effects (optional)

**Priority:** Low
**Effort:** Medium
**Impact:** Low (visual enhancement)

### 4. Accessibility Improvements

Further enhance accessibility:

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance audit
- Increased color contrast options
- Screen reader optimization
- Keyboard shortcuts documentation

**Priority:** Medium
**Effort:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium (increases usability for all users)

## Implementation Recommendations

### Short-term (1-2 months)

1. **Complete Touch Support** - Address the most critical technical debt by implementing touch events for mobile devices.

2. **Add Basic Testing** - Implement basic unit tests for core functionality.

3. **Accessibility Audit** - Conduct a thorough accessibility audit and address critical issues.

### Medium-term (3-6 months)

1. **Implement Panel Enhancements** - Add panel grouping and snapping.

2. **Add Build System** - Implement a basic build and bundling system.

3. **Complete Test Coverage** - Expand test suite to cover all critical functionality.

### Long-term (6+ months)

1. **Offline Support** - Implement offline-first architecture.

2. **Enhanced Theme System** - Add user-created themes and theme editor.

3. **Advanced Panel Features** - Implement panel templates library and advanced functionality.

## Conclusion

While the UI modernization effort has significantly improved the codebase, there remains some technical debt and opportunities for enhancement. Addressing the touch support issue should be the highest priority, followed by implementing proper testing and build systems.

The application now has a solid foundation for these improvements, with clean architecture and proper separation of concerns. Future enhancements can build upon this foundation to create an even better user experience.
