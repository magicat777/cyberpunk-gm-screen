## Next Steps

The remaining task to complete is adding touch event support for mobile devices. This would make the application fully responsive and usable on touch screens.

Implementation plan for touch support:
1. Add touchstart, touchmove, touchend event handlers to panel dragging
2. Implement pinch-to-resize for panel resizing
3. Add touch-friendly controls and interactions
4. Test on various mobile devices and screen sizes
