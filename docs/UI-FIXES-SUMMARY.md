   - Added the correct script reference
   - Added missing event listeners for all panel types
   - Added layout menu functionality with full implementations
   - Applied all fixes to both docs and src versions

2. **Fixed index.html iframe loading**
   - Changed iframe to load the functional app.html instead of broken app-modern.html
   - Ensures users see a working version of the application
