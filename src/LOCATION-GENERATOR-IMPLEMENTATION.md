# Location Generator Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the Location Generator panel in the Cyberpunk GM Screen. The Location Generator follows the same tabbed interface pattern established with the NPC Generator, Loot Generator, and Netrunning panels.

## Current Status
- We have implemented the `createLocationGeneratorContent()` function that defines the HTML structure
- We have added the case statement in the panel type switch
- We have referenced the `initializeLocationGenerator()` function in the panel content initialization
- **Current Task**: Implement the full `initializeLocationGenerator()` function

## Location Generator Features
The Location Generator will include:

1. **Generator Tab**
   - Generate random locations with customizable parameters
   - Control options for location type, district, security level
   - Detailed location description with NPCs, hooks, and features
   - Save generated locations to local storage

2. **Saved Locations Tab**
   - View and manage previously saved locations
   - Load, edit, and delete saved locations
   - Export/import location data

3. **District Map Tab**
   - Interactive SVG map of Night City districts
   - District information and statistics
   - Visual representation of security zones
   - Connection to location generation options

## Data Structures
The location generator will use the following data structures:

```javascript
// District data with characteristics
const districts = {
  "city-center": {
    name: "City Center",
    description: "Corporate headquarters and luxury living",
    securityLevel: "high",
    locationTypes: ["corp", "apartment", "government", "restaurant"],
    encounterRisk: "low",
    wealthLevel: "high"
  },
  "watson": {
    name: "Watson",
    description: "Industrial area with working class residents",
    securityLevel: "medium",
    locationTypes: ["shop", "apartment", "warehouse", "gang", "bar"],
    encounterRisk: "medium",
    wealthLevel: "medium"
  },
  // Additional districts...
};

// Location types with features and NPCs
const locationTypes = {
  "bar": {
    name: "Bar/Club",
    features: ["Dance floor", "VIP lounge", "Private booths", "Stage", "Gambling corner"],
    npcs: ["Bartender", "Bouncer", "Regular patron", "Dealer", "Performer"],
    itemsPresent: ["Drinks", "Drugs", "Food", "Music equipment"],
    hooks: ["Shady deal going down", "Famous performer tonight", "Gang territory dispute"]
  },
  // Additional location types...
};
```

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Core Location Generation Logic
- Implement weighted random selection based on district and location type
- Generate interconnected elements (security level affects NPC types, etc.)
- Create detailed descriptions with environmental elements

### 2. UI Functionality
- Tab switching between generator, saved locations, and map
- Interactive controls that affect generation parameters
- Save/load functionality with localStorage

### 3. Map Integration
- Interactive SVG map with district highlighting
- Connection between map selection and generator options
- Visual representation of security levels and district characteristics

### 4. API Integration
- Ensure proper event handling for all UI elements
- Connect to existing panel system architecture
- Implement consistent error handling and validation

## Next Steps
1. Implement the `initializeLocationGenerator()` function
2. Add district data and location type definitions
3. Create the random generation algorithm
4. Implement save/load functionality with localStorage
5. Develop the interactive district map
6. Add event handlers for UI interactions
7. Test the implementation thoroughly

## Technical Requirements
- Match the existing style and code patterns of other generator panels
- Follow accessibility guidelines for all UI elements
- Use consistent variable naming and code structure
- Implement proper error handling
- Make the panel fully responsive

This implementation will complete the Location Generator panel and provide another useful tool for Cyberpunk RED game masters.
