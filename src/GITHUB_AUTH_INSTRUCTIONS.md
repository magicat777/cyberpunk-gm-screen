# GitHub Authentication Instructions

As shown in the error message, GitHub has disabled password authentication for HTTPS connections. You have two options to proceed:

## Option 1: Use a Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. Create a personal access token on GitHub:
   - Go to GitHub â†’ Settings â†’ Developer Settings â†’ Personal Access Tokens â†’ Tokens (classic)
   - Click "Generate new token" â†’ "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it a name like "Cyberpunk GM Screen"
   - Select scopes: at minimum `repo` (full control of private repositories)
   - Click "Generate token" and **copy the token immediately**

2. Update your repository URL to include the token:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/magicat777/cyberpunk-gm-screen.git
   ```

3. Or use the token as your password when prompted:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/navigation-implementation
   # When prompted for password, enter your personal access token
   ```

## Option 2: Switch to SSH Authentication

1. Check if you already have SSH keys:
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/.ssh
   ```

2. If not, generate a new SSH key:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

3. Add the SSH key to the ssh-agent:
   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

4. Add the SSH key to your GitHub account:
   - Copy the SSH public key to clipboard:
     ```bash
     cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
     ```
   - Go to GitHub â†’ Settings â†’ SSH and GPG keys â†’ New SSH key
   - Paste your key and save

5. Change your repository's remote URL to use SSH:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:magicat777/cyberpunk-gm-screen.git
   ```

6. Push your changes:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/navigation-implementation
   ```

## Creating a Pull Request Manually

After pushing your branch, create a PR through the GitHub web interface:

1. Go to: https://github.com/magicat777/cyberpunk-gm-screen/compare/main...feature/navigation-implementation

2. Use this title: "Implement standardized navigation across primary interfaces"

3. Use this description:
   ```markdown
   ## Summary
   - Adds standardized navigation component to all primary interfaces
   - Implements breadcrumb navigation for improved user orientation
   - Ensures consistent navigation UI, login/logout functions
