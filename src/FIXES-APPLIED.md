# Fixes Applied to Cyberpunk GM Screen

This document outlines the issues identified and fixes applied to the Cyberpunk GM Screen project.

## Issues Identified

1. **app-modern.html Panel Functionality Issues**
   - Problem: Panels were not interactive; only theme switching worked
   - Root cause: Missing script reference to `app-modern.js` and conflicting script references

2. **index.html Loading Issues**
   - Problem: Loading broken `app-modern.html` in iframe
   - Root cause: Iframe pointed to non-functional version instead of working `app.html`

3. **Repository Structure Issues**
   - Problem: Multiple branches with similar files in different states
   - Root cause: Unclear branching strategy and merge process

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed app-modern.html

The file had several issues that needed to be fixed:

1. **Missing main JavaScript reference**:
```diff
- <script src="js/hotfix.js"></script>
- <script src="js/debug-panel.js"></script>
- <script src="js/panel-fix.js"></script>
- <script src="js/table-save.js"></script>
- <script src="js/layout-save-improved.js"></script>
+ <script src="js/app-modern.js"></script>
```

2. **Missing event listeners for panel creation**:
Added event listeners for all panel types (initiative tracker, game timer, weapons table, etc.) that were previously missing.

3. **Missing layout menu functionality**:
Added event handlers and supporting functions for all layout menu options:
- Save Layout
- Load Layout
- Clear Layout
- Reset Layout
- Auto-Organize
- Fit to Window

This fix was applied to both:
- `/docs/app-modern.html`
- `/src/frontend/app-modern.html`

### 2. Fixed index.html

The file was loading the broken `app-modern.html` in an iframe. Changed to load the working `app.html` instead:

```diff
- <iframe src="app-modern.html" 
+ <iframe src="app.html" 
          title="Cyberpunk GM Screen Application" 
          aria-label="Cyberpunk GM Screen Contents"
          id="app-frame"
          name="app-frame"></iframe>
```

## Recommended Branching Strategy

For future development, we recommend the following branching strategy:

1. **Main Branch (`main`)**
   - Always contains stable, deployable code
   - GitHub Pages deploys from `/docs` folder on this branch
   - Protected from direct pushes

2. **Development Branch (`develop`)**
   - Integration branch for features
   - Should always be in a working state
   - Features are merged here first before going to main

3. **Feature Branches (`feature/feature-name`)**
   - Created from `develop`
   - Used for developing new features
   - Merged back to `develop` when complete

4. **Hotfix Branches (`hotfix/issue-name`)**
   - Created from `main`
   - Used for critical fixes to production
   - Merged to both `main` and `develop`

## Workflow for Development

1. Create a feature branch from `develop`
2. Develop and test the feature
3. Create a PR to merge back to `develop`
4. After testing in `develop`, create a PR to merge to `main`
5. Deploy from `main` branch

## Next Steps

1. Create PR to merge current changes to `main`
2. Complete the modernization work for panels
3. Add touch support for mobile devices
4. Implement CI/CD improvements
