## Current Application State

The application now has:
- Proper semantic structure with header, main content, and footer
- Working panel system for creating, moving, and resizing panels
- Consolidated debug tools with advanced functionality
- Functional notes panel with save/load capabilities
- Correct paths and references for all resources
- Improved accessibility features
- Theme-consistent styling across components

## Remaining Issues

The following issues are still pending:

1. CP-011: Improve semantic HTML structure (High priority)
