## Testing Process

1. Start with a fresh page load (clear localStorage if needed)
2. Test each panel type creation
3. Test interactions (dragging, resizing, closing)
4. Test layout functions (save, load, clear, reset)
5. Test settings (theme, font, animations)
6. Repeat tests across different browsers and devices

## Test Reporting

For any issues found:
1. Document the exact steps to reproduce
2. Capture screenshot or screen recording
3. Note browser version and OS
4. Check console for any errors
5. Document expected vs. actual behavior

## Successful Implementation Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. All panel types function correctly
2. Dragging and resizing works with both mouse and touch
3. Layout functionality correctly persists panel arrangements
4. Theme switching and font settings work as expected
5. The application is accessible via keyboard
6. No console errors occur during normal operation
7. The application performs well with multiple panels open
8. All features work across major browsers and devices

## Post-Implementation Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
1. User feedback on functionality
2. Any reported browser compatibility issues
3. Performance on different devices
4. Accessibility feedback and improvements
