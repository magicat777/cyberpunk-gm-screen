# Remaining UI Fixes for Cyberpunk GM Screen

This document outlines the remaining UI issues in the Cyberpunk GM Screen application after fixing the duplicate debug panel problem (CP-009). The following issues have been identified and added to the issue tracker.

## CP-018: Footer Positioning Issue

### Problem
The footer element is currently taking up the entire window height instead of being positioned at the bottom of the content. This causes usability issues as it obscures the main content area.

### Solution Requirements
1. Fix the footer CSS to ensure it remains at the bottom of the page
2. Maintain a consistent height for the footer
3. Ensure the footer doesn't overlap with the main content
4. Make sure the footer is responsive on different screen sizes

### Implementation Plan
1. Update the `.quick-links-footer` CSS class with proper positioning
2. Implement a sticky footer pattern that works across browsers
3. Adjust the main content area to account for the footer height
4. Test on multiple screen sizes to ensure responsiveness

## CP-019: Header and Viewport Issues

### Problem
The main header and viewport configuration need to be restored for proper navigation and display. The current implementation has removed some key elements from the header.

### Solution Requirements
1. Restore proper header styling and functionality
2. Ensure the viewport meta tag is correctly configured
3. Fix navigation elements in the header
4. Make sure the header is properly responsive

### Implementation Plan
1. Restore any missing navigation elements
2. Update the header CSS to ensure proper styling
3. Check and update the viewport meta tag if needed
4. Test header display on various screen sizes

## CP-020: Debug Tool Subfunctions Not Working

### Problem
The debug panel system has been consolidated, but the subfunctions within the debug panel (system info, panel debug, storage, and console) are not functioning correctly.

### Solution Requirements
1. Fix the tab switching functionality in the debug panel
2. Ensure all debug panel features work correctly:
   - System information display
   - Panel debugging tools
   - Local storage management
   - Console functionality

### Implementation Plan
1. Debug the tab switching mechanism in debug-panel-consolidated.js
2. Fix event listeners for tab buttons
3. Ensure proper display/hiding of tab content
4. Test each debug function separately to confirm they work

## CP-021: Footer Links Not Properly Connected

### Problem
The quick links in the footer section are not properly connected to their corresponding pages in the `/src/frontend/pages` directory.

### Solution Requirements
1. Link all footer items to their correct pages
2. Update paths to point to the proper locations in /src/frontend/pages
3. Ensure all linked pages exist
4. Add proper error handling for any missing pages

### Implementation Plan
1. Map each footer link to its corresponding page:
   - Quick Access links → Corresponding panel creation functions
   - Resources links → Appropriate pages in /src/frontend/pages
   - About links → Pages like about.html, license.html, etc.
2. Update the href attributes with correct relative paths
3. Create any missing pages that should be linked
4. Implement fallback behavior for any unavailable pages

## Testing Approach

For each of these issues, the following testing approach should be used:

1. **Visual Testing**: Verify the visual appearance of the fixed components
2. **Functional Testing**: Test all interactive elements to ensure they work
3. **Responsive Testing**: Test on multiple screen sizes/devices
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Test on multiple browsers

## Documentation Requirements

For each fix implemented, update the following documentation:

1. Update cpunk-issues-tracker_250510.md to mark the issue as fixed
2. Create a detailed description of the fix in an appropriate .md file
3. Add any necessary information to PANEL_DEBUG_PR.md or create a new PR document

## Dependencies

These issues should be addressed in the following order to minimize conflicts:

1. CP-019: Header and viewport issues (foundational)
2. CP-018: Footer positioning (depends on proper viewport)
3. CP-021: Footer links (depends on footer positioning being fixed)
4. CP-020: Debug tool subfunctions (can be addressed independently)

## Acceptance Criteria

The fixes will be considered complete when:

1. All issues are resolved without introducing new problems
2. The application works correctly across different browsers
3. The application is responsive on different screen sizes
4. Documentation is updated to reflect all changes made
