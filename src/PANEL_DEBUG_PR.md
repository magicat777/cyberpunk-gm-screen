# Debug Panel Consolidation PR

## Purpose
This PR fixes issue CP-009: "Duplicate debug tool panels" by consolidating the "Debug Tools" and "Emergency Debug Tools" panels into a single, consistent interface.

## Implementation Details

The implementation consists of three main components:

1. **debug-panel-consolidated.js**: A comprehensive implementation that provides a unified debug panel with multiple tabs for system info, panel debugging, local storage management, and console functionality.

2. **debug-init.js**: An initialization script that ensures only one debug panel is displayed by redirecting all debug panel creation functions to the consolidated implementation and cleaning up any duplicate panels.

3. **debug-panel-test.html**: A test page that verifies the proper functioning of the consolidated debug panel system.

## Files Changed

- Added `/src/frontend/js/debug-panel-consolidated.js`
- Added `/src/frontend/js/debug-init.js`
- Added `/src/frontend/debug-panel-test.html`
- Modified `/src/frontend/app-modern-accessible-fixed.html` to include the consolidated scripts
- Created documentation in `/docs/DEBUG-PANEL-CONSOLIDATION.md`

## Testing Done

The implementation was tested using debug-panel-test.html, which verifies:
- Different debug panel creation functions create only one panel
- Multiple calls to create panels only show one panel
- The debug button correctly opens a single panel
- Panel tabs function correctly
- All debugging functionality works as expected

Manual testing was performed on the full application to ensure no regressions.

## Screenshots

N/A - The visual appearance is similar to the original debug panel but with enhanced functionality.

## Deployment Notes

The solution requires no external dependencies and should work with all modern browsers.
